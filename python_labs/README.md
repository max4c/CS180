# Instructions:

Welcome to the Python lab section of the class! The purpose of the Python labs are is intended to get you more familiar with the Python programming language. You’ll be coding the majority of Python labs in Pycharm (Or whatever IDE you want, we don’t care that much as long as the output matches the autograder). 

Each Python lab will have the following sections: a description, some test cases (we provide 3 per lab), and the deliverable instructions. The description will give you a basic description of the lab, and the requirements for completing the lab successfully. Some labs may have specific library requirements, you are not permitted to use any libraries besides the ones listed. The test cases will give you example output and input for the lab, if you get the right answer for the test cases, you can be confident that you’ll get 100% on the assignment. That being said, the autograder will test your code using different test cases than the ones provided. And the deliverable will be the instructions for you to turn in the files correctly.

When naming your Python file, please be sure to name it your **netid** with all lowercase. This will make it easier for the TA(s) to grade via an autograder. 

There is some starter code that is available to you to make set up a little bit easier for the Python labs. We recommend using it to save time and focus on the actual programming.
